Estimating the Market value of Soccer players based on their club and playing position

In this analysis I am trying to estimate the market price of the soccer players based on their playing position and the club which they represent.I have collected data from http://www.transfermarkt.com .The data contains of 198 players who are playing for different clubs in English Premiere League(First Division league in England).The Playing position of any player are classified into below four positions
- Forward
- Midfielder
3. Defender
4. GoalKeeper

Any football team will generally have 1-goalkeeper,3-5 Defenders,4-5 Midfielders and 1-3 Forwards.The Player can belong to 4 categories of teams (Team-1, Team-2, Team-3, Team-4 ).The Team categories are formed based on the market value of the team,The teams with higher market values fall in team-1 and lower in team-4.

The analysis will give the main effects and interaction effects of teams and position of the player.Do the teams value players more who play at a particular position.You can the results of my analysis in ANOVA.docx and R code in market.R
